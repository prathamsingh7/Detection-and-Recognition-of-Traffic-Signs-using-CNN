Traffic signs are important as they help the drivers to follow traffic rules and reduce the number of accidents on road. However, it is often very difficult for a driver to focus on the signs along with the other happenings on the road. In addition to this, traffic sign detection is also very important for the fast growing technology of automated driving and driverless cars. 

# Objective of this project
- To implement a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for accurate traffic sign detetction.

- Establishing a reliable Traffic Sign detection mechanism is a major step in our journey towards building semi-autonomous/autonomous driving systems.

# Dataset
- The traffic sign dataset that we will be working on is GTSRB — German Traffic Signs.  

- The dataset is pre-processed, shuffled and augmented using ***Tensorflow*** and ***Keras***. The shape of the data is (30,30).

- The dataset can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign).
